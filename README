Sudoku-based password generator

To make this work, I use a simple preexisting sudoku solver to create
a random sudoku solution.  The one I work with comes from here:

	http://davidbau.com/downloads/sudoku.py
	(via http://davidbau.com/about/hacks.html )

You will have to download this file and put it in the same directory as
sudoku_password_card.py for it to work.

This generator prints out two boards adjacent to each other with 9 random
passwords substituted in for digits 0-8 in each row.

Each 9-char password has 2 ascii upper case, 3 ascii lower case, 2 digits,
and 2 symbols.

The resulting sudoku-permuted rows, columns and 3x3 cells are thus
all strong passwords with uppercase, lowercase, digits and symbols.

From one sudoku board you can therefore pick
  rows & columns, forward & backward, 2 boards => 72 passwords
  cells, RD, RU, LD, LU on 2 boards => 72 passwords

Therefore, you can get 144 strong passwords from a two-board card.
